### General information:
This repository contains the following files:
- models: R script to obtain linear mixed effect models used to decipher the most relevant driving variables, including soil characteristics and climatic variables, for microbial biomass (prokaryotes and fungi) and a range of different soil functions (extracellular enzyme activities and microbial aerobic respiration)
- my_data_models: csv file with the dataset used for the models.
- legend: csv file with the descripton of the acronyms and units for each variable from my_data_models.

### Explanation of study:
This repository is related to the publication (Doménech-Pascual et al., 2025), where soil samples from a natural humid to arid climate gradient across the Iberian Peninsula were sampled in order to identify the main drivers of soil function variability along that gradient.

Here the list of the name of each site sampled with their respective coordinates:
