### General information:
This repository contains the following files:
- models: R script to obtain linear mixed effect models used to decipher the most relevant driving variables, including soil characteristics and climatic variables, for microbial biomass (prokaryotes and fungi) and a range of different soil functions (extracellular enzyme activities and microbial aerobic respiration)
- my_data_models: csv file with the dataset used for the models.
- legend: csv file with the descripton of the acronyms and units for each variable from my_data_models.

### Explanation of study:
This repository is related to the publication (REFERENCE OF THE MS), where soil samples from a natural humid to arid climate gradient across the Iberian Peninsula were sampled in order to identify the main drivers of soil function variability along that gradient.
